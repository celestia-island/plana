//! Subsystem A — peer replicas (load-balancing ⊃ rolling update).
//!
//! Peers are equal and active-active; state is externalised to a shared
//! store (Postgres for entelecheia / shittim-chest), so replicas need no
//! state replication between them — only a registry of who is online and
//! who is draining. Rolling update is a maintenance operation of this
//! subsystem: add a new replica (new generation) → wait `/readyz` → mark an
//! old replica `Draining` → let it finish and exit → repeat.
//!
//! The registry trait below is the contract backends (a shared DB table, or
//! a file-based store for single-host deployments) will implement. Full
//! backends + the manifest-queue orchestrator are staged for a later phase.
