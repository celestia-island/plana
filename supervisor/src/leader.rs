//! Subsystem B — leader/follower (edge active-passive HA).
//!
//! On a device (notably an evernight gateway) two processes run as
//! leader/follower for fault tolerance. The leader exclusively owns the
//! physical I/O (PLC/serial/CAN connections); the follower stands by and
//! promotes only when the leader's lease expires. Only the supervisor is
//! made HA — per-resource workers are simply restarted on crash
//! (`WorkerSpec` + `Supervisor`), the OTP let-it-crash simplification.
//!
//! The [`LeaderElector`] trait below fixes the lease-election contract.
//! Concrete backends (a lease file + TTL, or a DB advisory lock) are staged
//! for a later phase.
